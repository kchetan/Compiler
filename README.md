## Description

Compiler for [Decaf](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-035-computer-language-engineering-spring-2010/projects/MIT6_035S10_decaf.pdf) 
Programming Language. Developed as a course project for Compilers course.
Decaf  is  a  strongly-typed,  object-oriented  language  with  support  for  inheritance  and  encapsulation. By design, it has many similarities with C/C++/Java.


Developed a compiler front-end for Decaf(a subset of C++) to LLVM IR.

Wrote the lexical and syntax analyzer (parser), Abstract Syntax Tree generator for the parsed program.

Implemented the LLVM IR generator to obtain LLVM IR for the source program.
